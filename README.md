# Power Electronics Application in DC Motor Drives

## üìå Project Overview
This project, developed by **Sarwan Shah** at the **Dhanani School of Science and Engineering, Habib University**, explores the application of **Power Electronics** in **DC Motor Drives**. It covers the design, control strategies, and MATLAB-Simulink modeling of motor drive circuits, including **AC to DC rectification** and **quadrant control** for industrial DC motors.

## üõ† Features  
- **AC to DC Rectification**  
  - Conversion of **3-phase AC** to **DC** using a **6-pulse rectifier**.
  - Improved power delivery with reduced I¬≤R losses and smoothed output through filtering inductors.
  - Control using **thyristor-based gate firing** for dynamic control of power output.

- **Motor Control Strategies**
  - **1-Quadrant Control**: Basic motor speed control using adjustable firing angles.
  - **2-Quadrant Control**: Introduction of **dynamic braking** and **regenerative braking**.
  - **4-Quadrant Control**: Advanced full control over motor speed, torque, and braking, reducing reactive power consumption.

- **MATLAB-Simulink Model**
  - Demonstrates real-time behavior of DC motor drives with adjustable parameters.
  - Supports analysis of voltage, current, and power stress based on varying firing angles.

## üèó Project Implementation  
### ‚û§ **AC to DC Rectification**  
- Utilizes a **3-phase, 6-pulse rectifier** circuit to ensure higher average DC voltage output.
- Integration of **filtering inductors** to maintain a steady current and reduce losses.

### ‚û§ **Thyristor Control**  
- **Thyristors** operate based on gate-firing principles to modulate power delivery.
- Gate pulses synchronized with AC phase for continuous conduction over 120¬∞.

### ‚û§ **Quadrant Control**  
- **1-Quadrant Control**: Allows for acceleration and coasting with limited control over braking.
- **2-Quadrant Control**: Enables fast deceleration and reverse current flow for regenerative braking.
- **4-Quadrant Control**: Employs two converters for comprehensive speed, torque, and direction control.

### ‚û§ **MATLAB-Simulink Modeling**  
- Simulates real-world behavior of motor drives.
- Visualizes the impact of firing angles on voltage, current, and reactive power.

## ‚ö† Design Challenges  
- High reactive power consumption at greater firing angles.
- Erratic motor behavior at lower speeds due to pulsating currents.
- Complexity and cost of implementing full 4-quadrant control.
